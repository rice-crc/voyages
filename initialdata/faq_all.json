The reason for doing this is to see more clearly the effects of other variables. Consider the following example. In the Voyages Database, a researcher wishes to examine differences in mortality on slave voyages organized in Great Britain and mainland North American colonies. She begins by setting three criteria in the query frame: a) time frame: 1700-1749; b) place where voyage began: Great Britain (clicking on Great Britain, England, Scotland, and Ireland); and c) outcome of voyage for owners: Delivered slaves for original owners. Time frame is selected because the researcher wants to see if any difference between British and American voyages persisted over time. She plans to obtain results first for the period 1700-49, and then for 1750-99. The second variable, where the voyage began, is the one whose effect on mortality the researcher is interested in. The third variable, outcome for owner, is the control variable. It will not change throughout the analysis. It affects the results, but the researcher is more interested in the effect of the place where the voyage was organized. By limiting the analysis only to voyages completed as the owner of the venture intended, the researcher is able to eliminate the effect on results of other possible outcomes, such as shipwreck or capture at see by an enemy ship.</p>",
