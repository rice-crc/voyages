Imputed variables do not refer to information found in a source but to information inferred by historians from information that is found directly in sources. Data variables (variables in the database without asterisks) are documented directly from &nbsp;primary sources that provide evidence of a slaving voyage. For example, historical documents rarely indicate that a port where slaves disembarked was the principal place of landing, but when documentation exists on the number of slaves disembarked at several ports, the historian can determine where the largest number were disembarked, the principal place of disembarkation for the voyage. In some cases, how many slaves embarked is documented, but not how many disembarked. From the survival rate on voyages with the same characteristics, we impute the number who did so on the voyage with missing information.

        "answer": "<p>A control variable is one that does not change (or is held constant) during analysis of data in order to minimize its effect on results. The reason for doing this is to see more clearly the effects of other variables. Consider the following example. In the Voyages Database, a researcher wishes to examine differences in mortality on slave voyages organized in Great Britain and mainland North American colonies. She begins by setting three criteria in the query frame: a) time frame: 1700-1749; b) place where voyage began: Great Britain (clicking on Great Britain, England, Scotland, and Ireland); and c) outcome of voyage for owners: Delivered slaves for original owners. Time frame is selected because the researcher wants to see if any difference between British and American voyages persisted over time. She plans to obtain results first for the period 1700-49, and then for 1750-99. The second variable, where the voyage began, is the one whose effect on mortality the researcher is interested in. The third variable, outcome for owner, is the control variable. It will not change throughout the analysis. It affects the results, but the researcher is more interested in the effect of the place where the voyage was organized. By limiting the analysis only to voyages completed as the owner of the venture intended, the researcher is able to eliminate the effect on results of other possible outcomes, such as shipwreck or capture at see by an enemy ship.</p>",

This copies an image of the entire page into memory. Then paste the image into a blank screen of an image editing program like Microsoft Paint (one of the accessories) or Adobe Photoshop. From this image, you can then select a part of the image of an entire page, for example, the title and table of Summary Statistics, copy it and paste it into another page which you can print or save. Print screen will not supply a title for a table, graph, or map, nor will it include sources, notes or the details of the query that produced your results. It may be more efficient to download the data into a spreadsheet, construct a table or graph there with title, notes, sources, and desired formatting, and print this instead.</p>",

        "answer": "<p>An average is a value that is typical or representative of all values for the group of persons or things it describes. It is important to remember that the meaning of an average should be judged by the amount of deviation of particular cases around it. For four voyages landing 250, 280, 310, 360 slaves respectively, and for three voyages with 100 slaves and one voyage with 900, the average is the same: 300 slaves. The standard deviation is the clue to how much the average resembles particular cases in the group for which it is calculated. Divide the standard deviation by the average. The smaller the quotient, the closer particular cases are to the average. The larger the quotient, the more variation there is above and below the average.</p>",

If you find this to be the case, use the left query frame to limit the number of categories or values to a manageable number. A bar chart is useful for comparing several categories on a numerical scale, for example, the number of voyages on British and Dutch vessels in the period 1641-1700, when development of sugar colonies in the Caribbean began, or number of slaves embarked in different regions of Africa, or the average size (in tons) of United States and British ships. Number of voyages, slaves embarked, and tonnage are all numerical variables. Flag or nationality and region are categorical variables. &nbsp;Use of the query frame to limit categories represented in a bar or pie chart is a key to making effective use of the feature.</p>",

To view a segment of time in more detail, click and drag bars on the left and right of the smaller chart area below the main chart area to the beginning and end year of the desired period.

        "answer": "<p>No. Both sections make use of Philip Curtin&rsquo;s widely used distinction of eight regions of the Africa where slaves were embarked for transportation to the Americas. These regions are segments of the African Atlantic coastline in Africa from Senegambia in the North to West Central Africa in the South, with an eighth region in South-east Africa. In the website, off-shore islands are grouped with the region to which they are closest in proximity: the Cape Verde islands and Madeira with Senegambia, the Banana islands and Bance island with Sierra Leone, the Guinea islands with the Bight of Biafra, St. Helena with West Central Africa (although slaves were only disembarked there), and Indian ocean islands, the Mascarene islands, and Madagascar with Southeast Africa.</p>",

        "question": "Are disembarkation regions in Estimates and the Voyages Database defined differently?",
        "answer": "<p>Yes. In the Voyages Database, the Caribbean forms one broad region, and major colonies are specific regions within it, with ports at a third level of analysis of geographical variables. In Estimates, on the other hand, broad regions include five wholly or partly within the Caribbean, broadly distinguished by colonizer nations: the British and French Caribbean, the Danish West Indies, and the Dutch and Spanish Americas. The two last had mainland as well as island colonies. The other broad regions are the same as in Search the database: Europe, Africa, Brazil, and Mainland North America.</p>",

When one clicks on the image to obtain a larger view with information about it, below the commentary on the right is a link to related voyages.

In addition to links <em>from</em> Images to other sections of the website, there are links from other sections like Essays (in Assessing the Slave Trade) <em>to</em> the Images section. One of the three tabs in voyage detail (the page with information on a voyage opened when the row where it appears in the List of voyages is clicked) is to &ldquo;Related images.&rdquo; </p>",
