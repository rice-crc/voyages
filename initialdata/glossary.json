The height of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to Brazil occurred in 1828-1829, as merchants rushed to outfit slaving ships. A Brazilian enforcement law went into effect in 1831 but proved to be ineffective.

        "description": "In 1697, Spain ceded the western half of the island of Hispaniola to France in the Treaty of Ryswick. By the mid-1700s St. Domingue became the leading sugar, coffee and indigo producer in the Caribbean, due to the efforts of the colony's enslaved African workforce. A slave rebellion broke out in August 1791 and soon turned into a Revolution, leading to the freedom of 500,000 enslaved Africans and to the creation of the Republic of Haiti (1804). The St. Domingue Revolution prompted Africans elsewhere in the Americas to revolt against their enslavement, and the Revolution entrenched white planters' opposition to amelioration or abolition."

        "term": "Sugar",
        "description": "During the era of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, cane sugar was the principle cash crop grown in the Plantation Americas. Sugar production techniques transferred from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic world, more specifically, in the mid-seventeenth century from the Portuguese island-colony Sao Tome to Portuguese Brazil. Four in five Africans shipped to the West Indies, between the 1620s-1860s, would have ended their lives on sugar plantations. Planting and growing sugar required large numbers of enslaved African workers working in the fields and in the sugar-production buildings. Africans forced to work in sugar production had lower life expectancies than those growing other crops."
