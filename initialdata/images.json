She departed from Nantes, in France, and carried 345 slaves \nfrom the coast of Africa, but she was intercepted by anti-slave trade cruisers before \nsailing to the Americas and taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The English had no rights to \ndetain vessels under the French flag, and the cruiser had approached the \u201cVigilante\u201d only \nin order to verify its papers. The French captain, fearing detention, opened fire killing \nseveral of the cruiser\u2019s crew. It was only then that the \u201cVigilante\u201d was taken captive and \nescorted to first Sierra Leone where the slaves were disembarked, and then to Plymouth, \nEngland, where the English captain hoped to lay murder charges. Abolitionists drew the \nvessel while it was in Plymouth. In the event, the vessel and crew were released without \ncharges. The image is of a plan of the \u201cVigilante\u201d, showing the slave decks and the \ninstruments used to chain the slaves. This plan was published as a fold out in a pamphlet \nprinted first in London and then Paris and other places in 1823.

The image is a picture of Salvador in the beginning of \nthe widely known boom of gold exports from Brazil.

        "description": "Access to the Gold Coast, in present day Ghana, was highly disputed by European \npowers involved in the slave trade. In the sixteenth century, gold was the main commodity \nattracting the attention of the early European powers trading on the Gold Coast. However, \nat the end of the seventeenth century the main commodity became slaves. The image is of an \nillustration of the Gold Coast in the late seventeenth century when the transition from \ngold to slaves occurred, based on the accounts of Jean Barbot. It shows several canoes \ncarrying slaves to vessels anchored off the coast. Towards the rear, the illustration \nshows this traffic occurring under the auspices of several forts lined along the coast. \nFrom the left to the right the forts indicated are: Elmina, St. Jago, Cape Corso, and Fort \nRoyal at Manfrow.

In the \n1600s New Calabar was the most important slaving and ivory location in the Bight of \nBiafra; by the 1730s Bonny emerged as the leading regional slaving port.
