{{#db-card db-card-title="Slave Trade Assessment"}}
This section of the Voyages website is organized around the three ways historians and researchers have used the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database to interpret the slave trade: essays, quantitative analysis, and maps. Interactive features of the “Estimates” sub-section enable users to raise their own questions about the full volume of the slave trade by year, national carrier, and routes of slaving expeditions, and obtain answers in the form of tables, a timeline, or maps.
