"<p>\n"
"\tA glance at the Sources section of “Understanding the Database” "
"establishes Voyages as the product\n"
"\tof an international research endeavor that has ranged far beyond the "
"labors of the current project team.\n"
"\tFrom the late 1960s, Herbert S. Klein and other scholars began to collect "
"archival data on slave-trading\n"
"\tvoyages from unpublished sources and to code them into a machine-readable "
"format. In the 1970s and 1980s,\n"
"\tscholars created a number of slave ship datasets, several of which the "
"current authors chose to\n"
"\trecode from the primary sources rather than integrate the datasets of "
"those scholars into the present set. By the late 1980s, there were\n"
"\trecords of approximately 11,000 individual trans-Atlantic voyages in "
"sixteen separate datasets, not all\n"
"\tof which were trans-Atlantic, nor, as it turned out, slave voyages. And of "
"course, some sets overlapped\n"
"\tothers. Several listings of voyages extracted from more than one source "
"had appeared in hard copy form,\n"
"\tnotably three volumes of voyages from French ports published by Jean "
"Mettas and Serge and Michelle Daget\n"
"\tand two volumes of Bristol voyages (expanded to four by 1996) authored by "
"David Richardson. The basis for\n"
"\teach dataset was usually the records of a specific European nation or the "
"particular port where slaving\n"
"\tvoyages originated, with the information available reflecting the nature "
"of the records that had survived\n"
"\trather than the structure of the voyage itself. Scholars of the slave "
"trade spent the first quarter century\n"
"\tof the computer era working largely in isolation, each using one source "
"only as well as a separate format,\n"
"\tthough the Curtin, Mettas, and Richardson collections were early "
"exceptions to this pattern.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tThe idea of creating a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave "
"voyages emerged from a\n"
"\tchance meeting of David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in the British Public "
"Record Office in 1990 while\n"
"\tthey were working independently on the early and late British slave "
"trades. At about the same time, David\n"
"\tRichardson was taking over detailed multisource work on the large mid-"
"eighteenth-century Liverpool shipping\n"
"\tbusiness begun years earlier by Maurice Schofield. All this work, together "
"with the Bristol volumes that Richardson\n"
"\thad already published, made it seem feasible to integrate the records for "
"the very large British slave trade for the\n"
"\tfirst time, and beyond that, given the available Dutch, French, and "
"Portuguese data, to collect a single dataset for\n"
"\tthe trade as a whole. Meetings in January, 1991 at the American Historical "
"Association and, in 1992, at the\n"
"\tW. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at Harvard "
"University, headed by Professor Henry L. Gates,\n"
"\tJr resulted in grant proposals to major funding agencies. In July 1993 the "
"project received funding from the National\n"
"\tEndowment for the Humanities with supplementary support coming from the "
"Mellon Foundation.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tBy the time the project began, Johannes Postma’s Dutch data had become "
"available (subsequently revised in 2003),\n"
"\tas had Stephen Behrendt’s compilation of the extensive British trade after "
"1779, and also the large and complex Richardson,\n"
"\tBeedham, and Schofield pre-1787 Liverpool Plantation Register data set, "
"all in machine-readable format. Quantities of smaller\n"
"\tsets of published material available only in hard-copy form had been "
"available for some time, and as awareness of the project increased,\n"
"\tscholars volunteered unpublished data. In the course of the next three "
"years, the project undertook three\n"
"\tmajor tasks. The first was standardizing the existing data. Pioneers in "
"the field had collected their data using different\n"
"\tdefinitions of variables, sometimes of apparently similar items of "
"information, as well as a range of organizational formats\n"
"\t(for example using ship-based rather than voyage-based data). The second "
"task was collating voyages which appeared in several\n"
"\tdifferent sets, converting single-source data sets into multisource "
"equivalents and even checking on the validity of old\n"
"\tcompilations. The third task, which became increasingly important as the "
"project progressed, was adding new information.\n"
"\tAbout half of the 27,233 voyage records subsequently published on the 1999 "
"CD-ROM in 1999 were new.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tVoyages is the product of a further great surge of information on the "
"slave trade that has happened since 1999. Latin-American\n"
"\tslaving expeditions were seriously under-represented on the CD-ROM, and, "
"as a consequence, between 2001 and 2005 a major research\n"
"\tinitiative was undertaken in Portuguese and Spanish language archives "
"around the Atlantic basins to address this deficiency.\n"
"\tThree years of funding for this work (from 2002 to 2005) came from the "
"Arts and Humanities Research Board of the United Kingdom\n"
"\tand was administered through the University of Hull with David Richardson "
"and David Eltis as the principal investigators. Manolo\n"
"\tFlorentino anchored the work in Rio de Janeiro, Roquinaldo Ferreira in "
"Luanda, and Jelmer Vos in Lisbon, and other European\n"
"\tarchives. The major documentary collections explored in this period were "
"in archives in Luanda, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Lisbon,\n"
"\tHavana, Madrid, Sevilla, Amsterdam, Middelburg, Copenhagen, and London as "
"well as the extensive eighteenth century newspaper\n"
"\tholdings of the Bodleian and British Libraries. But while this was "
"happening scholars unconnected with the project continued\n"
"\tto give generously of their time and the archival data that they "
"themselves had collected. While the range and depth of work\n"
"\tcompleted before the year 2000 was impressive, the size and scope of this "
"post-1999 research effort can be gauged by the fact\n"
"\tthat no less than sixty percent of the slave voyages in the Voyages "
"Database contain information unavailable in 1999. As the\n"
"\tcore dataset expanded, and called on greater varieties of sources, the "
"problem of double-counting grew ever larger and more\n"
"\tcomplicated. In this period we reached the point at which almost as many "
"resources had to be devoted to this as to gathering\n"
"\tthe data in the first place.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tThe construction of the present open access web site, Voyages was made "
"possible by yet a third major award in 2006, this one\n"
"\tlaunched from Emory University. Once more the National Endowment for the "
"Humanities was the source, but supplementary funding\n"
"\tcame from the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for Afro-American Research at "
"Harvard. While the research work continued during the\n"
"\ttwo year period of these grants, the thrust of the effort shifted to "
"presentation. The project team developed sophisticated\n"
"\tsearch interfaces for three different kinds of data, as well as estimates "
"of the size and direction of the trade. The web site would\n"
"\tprovide a range of ancillary material for educators including lesson plans "
"and maps. Perhaps most important, the new site would provide\n"
"\tan opportunity for researchers everywhere to continue to contribute their "
"discoveries and correct errors in the data that they might find. After\n"
"\ta peer-review process any new data or corrections will be added to the "
"core database at three year intervals. It is difficult to\n"
"\tthink of any international project of preserving and reconstructing "
"history which has depended more on collaboration than Voyages\n"
"\thas. It is even harder to think of one that provides a better basis for "
"such collaboration to continue into the future.\n"

"\tAfrican peoples embarked at ports from the Sierra Leone and Windward "
"Coasts. (3) But Dobo also\n"
"\tidentified himself as a member of the Kongoba nation, and he entered the "
"Court’s Liberated African\n"
"\tregister as “Ganga-longová” (African Names Database, ID 70345). Dobo came "
"from the interior of\n"
"\tGalinhas, an area occupied by Gola people, an ethnolinguistic subgroup of "
"Mel speakers who migrated\n"
"\tsouth to the Galinhas hinterland from the Kongba region (and called "
"themselves Kongoba). They\n"
"\teventually occupied a large section of the region between Lofa and Cape "
"Mount, displacing in\n"
"\ttheir expansion Dei groups. (4)\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tIn 1826, when Dobo was shipped to Cuba, Spanish slave agents were very "
"active on the Galinhas\n"
"\tcoast, and they traded extensively with local chiefs, especially those "
"from the warring Dei and\n"
"\tGola peoples. The Spanish obtained prisoners of war from both groups. (5) "
"The Dei belonged to the\n"
"\tKwa linguistic family, who occupied in the nineteenth century an area that "
"extended from the coast\n"
"\tto the hinterland of Galinhas. Gola expansion in the early nineteenth "
"century displaced the Dei,\n"
"\tcausing friction and eventually war. (6) Constant skirmishes between the "
"two parties produced\n"
"\tcontinual lots of captives who were marched to the coast. Spanish agents—"
"including the notorious\n"
"\tslave trader Pedro Blanco—stockpiled imported goods in coastal entrepôts "
"and maintained small sailing\n"
"\tcraft to shuttle slaves along the Sierra Leone and Windward Coasts. Vai "
"merchants, who belonged to the\n"
"\tMande linguistic family and who inhabited the coastal area of Galinhas, "
"acted as middlemen between the\n"
"\tEuropeans and the Dei and Gola slave traders. (7) Blanco and other Spanish "
"brokers had built a profitable\n"
"\tworking relationship with local Vai chiefs, and rapidly expanded their "
"operations by stationing agents at\n"
"\tCape Mount, Shebar, Digby (near Monrovia), Young Sestos, and nearby "
"outlets.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tThere is no information on how young Dobo entered slavery in his Gola "
"homeland. He might have been\n"
"\ta victim of a Dei raid on a Gola settlement, or sold by relatives, or born "
"as a slave and traded from\n"
"\this original community. It was common for Dei or Gola rulers who desired "
"imported goods to raid\n"
"\tneighboring peoples and send their captives to the coast in exchange for "
"items such as salt,\n"
"\ttobacco, and various metals, particularly brass objects. Not all slaves "
"traded from the interior,\n"
"\thowever, were captured in raids or prisoners of war. Some people in the "
"Galinhas hinterland\n"
"\twere born into slavery; some entered slave status by being orphaned. The "
"practice of bartering\n"
"\tchildren—and even sometimes adults—for food during famines was not "
"unknown. Children were also\n"
"\tsold to compensate for homicides and other crimes committed by relatives. "
"Adults expelled from\n"
"\ttheir original kin groups might also risk enslavement when forced to leave "
"their own kin groups\n"
"\tbecause of quarrels, threats, hunger, or criminal activity. Dobo could "
"have entered slavery in\n"
"\tany one of these ways. (8)\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tBefore reaching the Galinhas coast, Dobo had to travel many hundred miles "
"from the\n"
"\tGola hinterland, and almost certainly he was bought and sold more than "
"once during his\n"
"\tjourney. From his first capture, Dobo found himself surrounded by "
"strangers. Dobo was\n"
"\tprobably transferred from Gola or Dei traders to Vai middlemen who marched "
"him to the\n"
"\tcoast. As a newcomer in alien communities and separated from his own "
"ethnic group, Dobo\n"
"\tmust have had to redefine a new identity, social personality, and status. "
"New surroundings\n"
"\tusually implied new customs, languages, or dialects. (9)\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tWhen he arrived on the coast, Dobo was housed in a slave factory belonging "
"to one of the\n"
"\tSpanish factors around Galinhas before he was traded for imported "
"commodities. Cape Mount,\n"
"\tfrom whence the <span class=\"italic\">Fingal</span> had sailed, "
"functioned as an\n"
"\tauxiliary shipping point of the main slave entrepôt in the area, the "
"Galinhas River, between\n"
"\tthe Mano and Moa Rivers. At Cape Mount, several slave depots operated in "
"the 1820s and 1830s,\n"
"\tincluding one owned by Pedro Blanco. Once he was bartered for merchandise, "
"Dobo and 60 others\n"
"\twere taken on board the slaver by canoes. Conditions must have been "
"horrific on the schooner\n"
"\t<span class=\"italic\">Fingal</span>, and three slaves died during the "
"Atlantic crossing.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tThe treaty of 1817 clearly stipulated that emancipados, once disembarked, "
"came under the\n"
"\tjurisdiction of the nation in whose territory the court was located. Dobo "
"and his African\n"
"\tcompanions thus remained under the custody of Spain after registration. "
"They were assigned\n"
"\ta new “Christian” name and a tin ticket for identification, and began a "
"five-year labor\n"
"\tterm under some responsible trustee “to ease their transition to "
"civilization.” But these\n"
"\tterms could be extended legally to a maximum of three more years, and "
"other mechanisms\n"
"\texisted to prolong servitude indefinitely. Spanish colonial law also "
"decreed that trustees\n"
"\tneeded to feed and clothe their emancipados, provide medical care, "
"instruction in Catholicism\n"
"\tand train them in an occupation. (10) As Dobo’s story will show, many, if "
"not most emancipados,\n"
"\tfell victim to corruption and fraud. Trustees often kept them in servitude "
"and paid them only\n"
"\tnominal monthly wages after the expiration of their term.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tDobo was consigned for five years to Luisa Aper de la Paz, a rich widow "
"from Havana. She paid\n"
"\t612 pesos to bribe the authorities, and used Dobo, now named Gabino, as a "
"water-carrier, and paid\n"
"\thim only one peso per day. (11) After the end of his five-year term, she "
"paid further bribes to\n"
"\textend Gabino’s services for two more five-year terms. (12) Extending "
"Gabino’s involuntary servitude\n"
"\tgave Donna Aper de la Paz greater financial flexibility than purchasing a "
"slave: slaves required\n"
"\tlarge outlays of cash, and owners bore the risk that slaves would die or "
"escape. Hiring free\n"
"\tlaborers in Havana was also very expensive, and wageworkers could not be "
"controlled or exploited\n"
"\tlike emancipados. The emancipado system enabled “trustees” to obtain labor "
"at below-market rates\n"
"\tand avoid the long-term commitments, preoccupations, and maintenance costs "
"associated with slavery.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tAs an emancipado, Gabino was in limbo, neither free nor slave. His legal "
"status and day-to-day\n"
"\texistence combined the worst of two worlds. He did not enjoy the freedoms "
"and higher wages of free\n"
"\tpersons of color, nor did he have the few legal and material protections "
"that most slaves could\n"
"\treasonably expect. Further, Gabino needed to pay taxes to the colonial "
"government. After taxes,\n"
"\the lost two-thirds of his one-dollar per day salary. Gabino also was "
"isolated from the slave\n"
"\tcommunity in Havana, which devised their own solidarity mechanisms to "
"survive, resist and\n"
"\tpursue freedom. Emancipados were the object of contempt to both free "
"blacks and slaves. In\n"
"\tfact, blacks in Cuba used “emancipado” as a derogatory term (13), and "
"people like Gabino were\n"
"\tat the bottom of Cuba’s social ladder. They had no protection in the Cuban "
"colonial legal\n"
"\tsystem, and their only hope for redress was to gain the attention of a "
"foreign official,\n"
"\tsuch as the Superintendent of Liberated Africans in Havana.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tThe post of Superintendent was created by an additional Anglo-Spanish anti-"
"slave trade\n"
"\ttreaty signed in 1835. The new treaty allowed the adjudication of vessels "
"with slave trading\n"
"\tequipment on board—vessels thus could be seized before they embarked "
"slaves. (14) The treaty\n"
"\treflected the British government’s renewed interest in the welfare of "
"emancipados. It stipulated\n"
"\tthat emancipados would hereafter come under the authority of the capturing "
"nation. Further, every\n"
"\tsix months Spanish officials were required to provide the Havana Mixed "
"Commission with updated\n"
"\tregisters of emancipados. (15) The new measures had an immediate impact: "
"British officials no\n"
"\tlonger transferred emancipados to Spanish colonial authorities; they "
"instead began relocating\n"
"\tthem to several British Caribbean possessions, in which slavery had been "
"abolished (1834).\n"
"\tA Superintendent was appointed to oversee these arrangements.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tFrom the mid-1830s until 1841 two well-known British abolitionists, Dr. "
"Richard Robert Madden\n"
"\tand David Turnbull, occupied the post of Superintendent. The two were "
"members of the British and\n"
"\tForeign Anti-Slavery Society and came to Cuba ideologically committed to "
"the interests of liberated\n"
"\tAfricans. Turnbull replaced Madden in 1840 and also held the position of "
"British Consul in Havana.\n"
"\tThe British foreign secretary instructed Turnbull to persuade Cuban "
"authorities to obey the treaties\n"
"\tof 1817 and 1835, and to investigate the conditions of the emancipados and "
"protect their rights.\n"
"\tHowever, emancipados like Gabino, landed in Havana before 1835, remained "
"under the jurisdiction of\n"
"\tSpanish law and Spanish officials. The Superintendent could do no more "
"than investigate and denounce\n"
"\tcases that were in clear violation of the earlier treaty. Many emancipados "
"learned of the Superintendent’s\n"
"\tposition and sought his assistance. One of them was Gabino.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tWhen Mrs. Aper de la Paz died in 1840, Gabino’s livelihood deteriorated. "
"Felix Piñero, who inherited\n"
"\tthe widow’s property, cut off Dobo’s tiny remuneration as a water-carrier, "
"in violation of all conventions\n"
"\tregarding liberated Africans. (16) Gabino’s desperation led him to appeal "
"to Superintendent Turnbull. In his\n"
"\tdeclaration, Gabino narrated the abuse to which he had been subjected "
"since his arrival in Havana, then as\n"
"\tDobo. Turnbull immediately sent a strong note of protest to Cuban "
"officials claiming for him “the immediate\n"
"\tand unconditional enjoyment of the freedom which was guaranteed to him by "
"the treaties in force between\n"
"\tSpain and Great Britain.” By 1841, Gabino had been in Cuba for fifteen "
"years, and understood that the Spanish\n"
"\tlegal system was closed to him. He searched for an alternative method of "
"redress and found one.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tIn his note to the Captain General in Havana, Principe de Anglona, "
"Turnbull also claimed that Gabino\n"
"\twas entitled to all monies held from him unlawfully. The Captain General "
"responded by declaring Turnbull\n"
"\tto be a “persona non grata,” a danger to the island’s security because of "
"his links with “the people of\n"
"\tcolor.” Turnbull was also told in this letter that his intervention in "
"Gabino’s case “supposes that you\n"
"\tare qualified to listen to complaints and to offer protection to the "
"people of color, and to support\n"
"\ttheir pretensions.” The Captain General feared that “such a state of "
"things might loosen the ties of\n"
"\tsubordination and obedience among emancipados.” (17) The Captain General "
"thus opposed Turnbull’s defense\n"
"\tof emancipados’ rights, without addressing the specifics of Gabino’s case. "
"(18) Turnbull had in fact\n"
"\tpreviously traveled through the island to check on the conditions of the "
"emancipados working on plantations,\n"
"\tand had listened to the complaints of many other emancipados in Havana. He "
"was also seen accompanied by\n"
"\twhite Cubans who openly opposed slavery in the island. The Cuban colonial "
"government wanted Turnbull to\n"
"\tleave the island, and his official complaint in Gabino’s case gave them "
"the opportunity. The Superintendent\n"
"\twas forced to abandon his offices at the British Consulate in Havana and "
"move to a British vessel anchored\n"
"\tin the harbor, as he was not allowed to remain on Spanish soil. "
"Eventually, he had to sail to Jamaica. (19)\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tTurnbull, though forced to leave Cuba, achieved his immediate objective: "
"Gabino, at the age of 25, won\n"
"\this freedom. A letter from the Anglona’s successor as Captain General, "
"Geronimo Valdes, to the British Consulate,\n"
"\tdated June 23, 1841, stated that a letter of emancipation had been issued "
"for Gabino. The report also mentioned\n"
"\tthat Gabino had married a slave, Candelaria. (20) Gabino had achieved the "
"nearly impossible: he had overcome all\n"
"\tthe barriers imposed on emancipados by the Spanish colonial government and "
"gained his freedom. His decision to\n"
"\tbypass the Spanish legal system, importantly, produced a diplomatic crisis "
"between the British and Spanish governments.\n"
"</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>\n"
"\tIn late June 1841 Gabino began a new life as a free black man with a wife, "
"but the Spanish colonial government\n"
"\tdid not forget him. A few months after his letter of emancipation, he was "
"accused of conspiracy to foment a black\n"
"\tuprising and condemned to eight years in prison. He would need to serve "
"his sentence in a prison in Ceuta, a Spanish\n"
"\tenclave in northern Morocco, far from his wife. Paradoxically, Gabino now "
"returned to the African continent as a\n"
"\tcaptive. His freedom had lasted only a few months. In November 1841 he "
"left Havana imprisoned on board the Spanish\n"
"\tnaval warship <span class=\"italic\">Correo 4</span>. It was the second "
"time that Gabino crossed the\n"
"\tAtlantic, in both cases as a captive. The conditions on board the <span "
"class=\"italic\">Correo 4</span>\n"
"\twere undoubtedly as bad as those on the slaving vessel Fingal. Gabino was "
"gravely ill when the naval ship arrived\n"
"\tat the Spanish port Cadiz. A few days after disembarkation, he died in the "
"military prison. (21) Gabino, born Dobo,\n"
"\tnever reached the African continent. His story in Africa and in the "
"Americas illustrates the fate of thousands of\n"
"\tliberated Africans in Cuba. Dobo did not arrive in Cuba as a slave, but "
"like other emancipados, he lost his African\n"
"\tname, had his rights ignored, and was not remunerated for his work. Dobo, "
"a free youth from Gola, became Gabino, a\n"
"\tde-facto slave in Cuba.\n"

"\tthis assumption is confirmed by analysis of other sources. Other "
"\"departure\" dates included in the new slave trade data set are:\n"
"\tthe date vessels cleared customs; the dates Mediterranean passes were "
"issued; the dates bonds were given; the dates sailors’\n"
"\tpension monies were lodged; and the dates of vessel registration. These "
"events usually occurred within 1-2 months of departure.\n"
"\tLondon slave vessels cleared customs at Gravesend and often sailed from "

"\tcontrary south-westerly winds, departures from the Downs were often "
"delayed for several weeks. We included these dates of sail\n"
"\tfrom the Downs as London \"departure\" dates. A separate variable defines "
"these various \"departure\" dates. Reports of slave vessel\n"
"\tarrivals in the Americas generally reached Europe within six to ten weeks. "
"Without other documentary support we assumed the year\n"
"\tor (in select cases) month of arrival, when the evidence was clear from "
