	slave trade.” Adjusting for those carried to the offshore islands and Europe, this implies
	14.9 million headed for the Americas. See <span class="italic">Cahiers d’Etudes africaines</span>, 32 (1993):686.{% endblocktrans %}

<p>
	{% blocktrans %}<span class="superscript">6</span> One frequently cited shipping list reports that there were no
	children on board several British slave voyages in the 1790s (House of Lords Record Office, House of Lords,
	Main Papers, 28 July 1800). This document, however, omitted to report the children embarked (cf. BNA, T70/1574;
	House of Lords Record Office, House of Lords, Main Papers, 14, 25 June 1799). In Luanda and Benguela Portuguese
	customs reports of departures for Brazil report very low numbers of children embarked. But in this instance,
	“children” refers to infants only, and was above a tax category that indicated exemption from customs duties.{% endblocktrans %}

<p>
	{% blocktrans %}<span class="superscript">7</span> Mediterranean passes were issued by most European nations as a result of
	treaties with the Barbary powers. In theory, these documents allowed the vessels of the signing nation to pass
	freely through the “Mediterranean” waters frequented by Barbary corsairs. The passes record vessels’ and
	captain’s names, tonnage, the date the pass was issued, and intended trading location, such as “Africa”
	or “Africa and the Americas” or “Barbary” or “Madeira.” See David Richardson, <span class="italic"> The Mediterranean Passes in the Public Records Office </span> (East Ardsley, UK: EP Microform Ltd., 1981). On
	different numbers reported in the Americas, in the date given for the arrival of slave vessels might be the
	date the vessel cleared customs, but in fact this could easily occur 2-4 weeks after the actual arrival.{% endblocktrans %}

	dictionaries define armateurs firstly as those merchants who fit out the ship or expedition and secondly as (ship)owners.  See Emile
	Littré, <span class="italic">Dictionnaire de la Langue Française</span>, vol. I (Paris: Hachette, 1881), 194.{% endblocktrans %}

	(J. W. Norie and Co.: London, 1822). For a very detailed private record, see the manuscript in the Sidney Jones Library,

	“Percentage male embarked*” (MALRAT1), “Percentage male disembarked*” (MALRAT3), “Percentage children embarked*”

	{% blocktrans %}<span class="superscript">14</span> The 1773 legislation is 13 Geo III, c. 74. See W. Salisbury, “Early Tonnage Measurements in England:
	I, H.M. Customs and Statutory Rules,” <span class="italic">Mariner’s Mirror</span>, 52 (1966): 329–40. To convert registered
	tons into measured tons, we used the formulae in Christopher J. French, “Eighteenth Century Shipping Tonnage Measurements,”
	<span class="italic">Journal of Economic History</span> 33 (1973): 434–43. The 1786 act is 26
	Geo III, c. 60, and its 1835 counterpart is 5 and 6 Will IV, c. 56, which introduced different rules for
	empty ships (s. 2) and those with cargo (s. 6). As the latter appears to have been used on slave ships,
	it is the one adopted here, and a further regression equation allows us to convert post-1836 tonnages
	into the measured ton of 1773–1835. It is:
	<br>
	Y = 52.86 + (1.22 x X)   N = 63, R² = 0.77
	<br>
	where Y = measured tons, 1773–1835, and X = measured tons after 1835.{% endblocktrans %}
