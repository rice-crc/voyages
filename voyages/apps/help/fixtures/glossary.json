The height of the trans-Atlantic slave trade to Brazil occurred in 1828-1829, as merchants rushed to outfit slaving ships. A Brazilian enforcement law went into effect in 1831 but proved to be ineffective.

Planting and growing sugar required large numbers of enslaved African workers working in the fields and in the sugar-production buildings.
