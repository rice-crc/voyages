		{% blocktrans %}One of the goals of the
		Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database has been to bring the work of
		historians to a primary and secondary school audience, allowing
		students to engage in the process of historical inquiry. To that end,
		a variety of lesson plans spanning a range of grade levels have been
		developed to offer teachers diverse approaches from which to teach
		students about the largest forced migration in history. These lesson
		plans are tied to national standards in Social Studies (National
		Council for the Social Studies), History (National Center for History
		in the Schools), and Geography (National Council Geography Education).
		Relevant lesson plans and educational resources located on other
		websites have also been identified, to help educators build a broad
		study of the trans-Atlantic slave trade into their curriculum.{% endblocktrans %}

			and legacy of the Atlantic slave trade in diverse and meaningful
			ways. The lessons are all aligned with national standards in history
			(National Center for History in the Schools), social studies

			Council for Geography Education) and range in both their grade
			levels and activities. The lessons also suggest readings for more
