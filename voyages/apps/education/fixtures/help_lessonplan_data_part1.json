            "abstract": "In this lesson, students will examine the data of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and primary sources related to the slave trade. The data will easily reveal to students a steep incline before 1808 and, in fact, a continuation of imported enslaved Africans after the slave trade was abolished in the United States and Great Britain. Students will also examine perspectives on slavery, as the deadline for ending the slave trade approached and passed. The lesson allows students to develop their own conclusions about both the intention and impact of the 1808 deadline on the overall history of slavery. ",

The lesson contains several steps which teachers can use at their discretion to build an appreciation for what enslaved Africans were subjected to as they were forced to the New World, why this part of history should get a public memorial, and how that memorial should be expressed in words and image. The lesson uses mortality statistics from the database to help students gain an understanding of how many people died on a voyage, as well as reading comprehension questions and a PowerPoint Presentation of various monuments.",
