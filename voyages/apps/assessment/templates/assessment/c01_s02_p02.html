	{% blocktrans %}In examining seasonality in the trans-Atlantic slave trade,
	it is important to focus on agricultural history because the
	majority of people in the Atlantic world lived on farms, producing
	crops and raising livestock. During the era of the slave trade,
	1514-1866, most sub-Saharan Africans from rural communities, forced
	across the Atlantic, continued their farming lives by working New
	World lands. They grew some familiar provisions, including crops
	imported from Africa, like Guinea corn (millet) or West African
	rice. However, many saw crops such as sugar, tobacco, coffee,
	indigo, cacao, or cotton, for the first time.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}Though historians lack data on precolonial African
	demography, it is reasonable to suggest that most Africans forced
	overseas were farmers or pastoralists. Men and women, adults and
	children, helped to produce yearly supplies of millet, sorghum,
	rice, maize, yams, cassava, plantains, or other crops. The ratio of
	men, women, and children working on farms varied by crops and
	region, but all villagers worked together clearing land, planting,
	weeding, and storing crops to produce sufficient amounts of food to
	enable communities to survive through the out-of-crop hungry
	seasons. Smaller numbers of enslaved Africans transported across
	the Atlantic were craftsmen or professionals; as African towns grew
	in size in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, so too did
	the numbers of urban residents who were enslaved.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}For those eleven million African peoples who survived the
	Middle Passage, the majority would labor on plantation lands
	producing provisions and cash crops. As in Africa, ratios of men,
	women, and children working in the fields varied by crops and
	region, and the hungry months occurred before the yearâ€™s harvest.
	About 5.25 million African migrants worked in sugar cane, and
	perhaps 1.5 million toiled on tobacco, coffee, rice, indigo, cotton,
	and cacao estates. Another 1.5 million people worked in livestock
	pens, or on plantations producing millet, maize, wheat, cassava, or
	forestry products. An estimated one million enslaved Africans
	worked in silver and gold mining, but mostly before 1750. Brazilian
	gold, important particularly in 1690-1750, drew in perhaps 500,000
	African workers. Household work or ranching occupied the lives of
	750,000-1,000,000 African men, women and children.{% endblocktrans %}
