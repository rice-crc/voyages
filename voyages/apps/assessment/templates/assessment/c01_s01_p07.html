<p>
	{% blocktrans %}Whatever the route taken, conditions on board reflected the
	outsider status of those held below deck. No European, whether
	convict, indentured servant, or destitute free migrant, was ever
	subjected to the environment which greeted the typical African
	slave upon embarkation. The sexes were separated, kept naked,
	packed close together, and the men were chained for long periods. No
	less than 26 percent of those on board were classed as children, a
	ratio that no other pre-twentieth century migration could come close to
	matching. Except for the illegal period of the trade when
	conditions at times became even worse, slave traders typically
	packed two slaves per ton. While a few voyages sailing from Upper
	Guinea could make a passage to the Americas in three weeks, the
	average duration from all regions of Africa was just over two
	months. Most of the space on a slave ship was absorbed by casks of
	water. Crowded vessels sailing to the Caribbean from West Africa
	first had to sail south before turning north-west and passing
	through the doldrums. In the nineteenth century, improvements in
	sailing technology eventually cut the time in half, but mortality
	remained high in this period because of the illegal nature of the
	business. Throughout the slave trade era, filthy conditions ensured
	endemic gastro-intestinal diseases, and a range of epidemic
	pathogens that, together with periodic breakouts of violent
	resistance, meant that between 12 and 13 percent of those embarked
	did not survive the voyage. Modal mortality fell well below mean
	mortality as catastrophes on a relatively few voyages drove up
	average shipboard deaths. Crew mortality as a percentage of those
	going on board, matched slave mortality over the course of the
	voyage, but as slaves were there for a shorter period of time than
	the crew, mortality rates for slaves (over time) were the more
	severe. The eighteenth-century world was violent and
	life-expectancy was short everywhere given that the global
	mortality revolution was still over the horizon, but the human
	misery quotient generated by the forced movement of millions of
	people in slave ships cannot have been matched by any other human
	activity.{% endblocktrans %}
