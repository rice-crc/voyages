<h2>{% trans "The Enslavement of Africans" %}</h2>

<p>
	{% blocktrans %}But why were the slaves always African? One possible answer
	draws on the different values of societies around the Atlantic and,
	more particularly, the way groups of people involved in creating a
	trans-Atlantic community saw themselves in relation to others – in
	short, how they defined their identity. Ocean-going technology
	brought Europeans into large-scale face-to-face contact with
	peoples who were culturally and physically more different from
	themselves than any others with whom they had interacted in the
	previous millennium. In neither Africa nor Asia could Europeans
	initially threaten territorial control, with the single and
	limited exception of western Angola. African capacity to resist
	Europeans ensured that sugar plantations were established in the
	Americas rather than in Africa. But if Africans, aided by tropical
	pathogens, were able to resist the potential invaders, some
	Africans were prepared to sell slaves to Europeans for use in the
	Americas. As this suggests, European domination of Amerindians was
	complete. Indeed, from the European perspective it was much too
	complete. The epidemiological impact of the Old World destroyed not
	only native American societies, but also a potential labor supply.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}Every society in history before 1900 provided at least an
	unthinking answer to the question of which groups are to be
	considered eligible for enslavement, and normally they did not
	recruit heavily from their own community. A revolution in
	ocean-going technology gave Europeans the ability to get continuous
	access to remote peoples and move them against their will over very
	long distances. Strikingly, it was much cheaper to obtain slaves in
	Europe than to send a vessel to an epidemiologically coast in
	Africa without proper harbors and remote from European political,
	financial, and military power. That this option was never seriously
	considered suggests a European inability to enslave other
	Europeans. Except for a few social deviants, neither Africans nor
	Europeans would enslave members of their own societies, but in the
	early modern period, Africans had a somewhat narrower conception of
	who was eligible for enslavement than had Europeans. It was this
	difference in definitions of eligibility for enslavement which
	explains the dramatic rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.
	Slavery, which had disappeared from northwest Europe long before
	this point, exploded into a far greater significance and intensity
	than it had possessed at any point in human history. The major
	cause was a dissonance in African and European ideas of eligibility
	for enslavement at the root of which lies culture or societal
	norms, not easily tied to economics. Without this dissonance, there
	would have been no African slavery in the Americas. The slave trade
	was thus a product of differing constructions of social identity
	and the ocean-going technology that brought Atlantic societies into
	sudden contact with each other.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}The trans-Atlantic slave trade therefore grew from a strong
	demand for labor in the Americas, driven by consumers of plantation
	produce and precious metals, initially in Europe. Because
	Amerindians died in large numbers, and insufficient numbers of
	Europeans were prepared to cross the Atlantic, the form that this
	demand took was shaped by conceptions of social identity on four
	continents, which ensured that the labor would comprise mainly
	slaves from Africa. But the central question of which peoples from
	Africa went to a given region of the Americas, and which group of
	Europeans or their descendants organized such a movement cannot be
	answered without an understanding of the wind and ocean currents of
	the North and South Atlantics. There are two systems of wind and
	ocean currents in the North and South Atlantic that follow the
	pattern of <a href="{{ assessment_intro-maps }}#map4">giant wheels</a> - one lies north of the equator turns
	clockwise, while its counterpart to the south turns
	counterclockwise. The northern wheel largely shaped the north
	European slave trade and was dominated by the English. The southern
	wheel shaped the huge traffic to Brazil which for three centuries
	was almost the almost exclusive preserve of the largest slave
	traders of all, the Portuguese.(1) Despite their use of the
	Portuguese flag, slave traders using the southern wheel ran their
	business from ports in Brazil, not in Portugal. Winds and currents
	thus ensured two major slave trades – the first rooted in Europe,
	the second in Brazil. Winds and currents also ensured that Africans
	carried to Brazil came overwhelmingly from Angola, with south-east
	Africa and the Bight of Benin playing smaller roles, and that
	Africans carried to North America, including the Caribbean, left
	from mainly West Africa, with the Bights of Biafra and Benin and the
	Gold Coast predominating. Just as Brazil overlapped on the northern
	system by drawing on the Bight of Benin, the English, French, and
	Dutch carried some slaves from northern Angola into the Caribbean.{% endblocktrans %}
