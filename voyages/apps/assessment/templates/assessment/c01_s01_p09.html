	{% blocktrans %}In the Atlantic after 1492, oceans that had hermetically
	sealed peoples and cultures from each other sprouted sea-lanes
	almost overnight. Cultural accommodation between peoples, in this
	case between Europeans and non-Europeans, always took time. The big
	difference was that before Columbus, migrations had been gradual
	and tended to move outwards from the more to the less densely
	populated parts of the globe. But Columbian contact was sudden, and
	inhibited any gradual adjustment, cultural as well as
	epidemiological. A merging of perceptions of right and wrong, group
	identities, and relations between the sexes, to look only at the
	top of a very long list of social values, could not be expected to
	occur quickly in a post-Columbian world. In short, cultural
	adjustment could not keep pace with transportation technology. The
	result was first the rise, and then, as perceptions of the
	insider-outsider divide slowly changed, the fall, of the
	trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}During the long coercive interlude of forced trans-Atlantic
	migration European and African conceptions of self and community
	(and eligibility for enslavement) did not remain static. On the
	African side, the major effect of the African-European exchange was
	to encourage an elementary pan-Africanism, at least among victims.
	The initial and unintentional impact of European sea-borne contact
	was to force non-elite Africans to think of themselves as part of a
	wider African group. Initially, this group might be Igbo, or
	Yoruba, and soon, in addition, blacks as opposed to whites. At the
	most elemental level, by the late eighteenth century, the slaves at
	James Island vowed to drink the blood of the whitemen. In Gorée,
	a little later, one third of the slaves in a carefully planned
	conspiracy, “would go in the village and be dispersed to massacre
	the whites”. When asked “[w]hether it were true that they had
	planned to massacre all the whites of the island....[t]he two
	leaders, far from denying the fact or looking for prevarication,
	answered with boldness and courage: that nothing was truer”.(3)
	Many similar incidents could be cited from the Americas side of the
	Atlantic. And on board a slave ship with all the slaves always
	black, and the crew largely white, skin color defined ethnicity.{% endblocktrans %}
