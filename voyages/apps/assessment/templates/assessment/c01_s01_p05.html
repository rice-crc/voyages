	{% blocktrans %}In the second half of the eighteenth century six imperial
	systems straddled the Atlantic each one sustained by a slave trade.
	The English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and Danish all
	operated behind trade barriers (termed mercantilistic restrictions)
	and produced a range of plantation produce - sugar, rice, indigo,
	coffee, tobacco, alcohol, and some precious metals - though with
	sugar usually the most valuable. It is extraordinary that
	consumers’ pursuit of this limited range of exotic consumer goods,
	which collectively added so little to human welfare, could have
	generated for so long the horrors and misery of the Middle Passage
	and plantation slavery. Given the dominance of Portuguese and
	British slave traders, it is not surprising that Brazil and the
	British Americas received the most Africans, though both nations
	became adept at supplying foreign slave systems as well. Throughout
	the slave trade, more than seven out of every ten slaves went to
	these regions. The French Americas imported about half the slaves
	that the British did, with the majority going to Saint-Domingue.
	The Spanish flag, which dominated in the earliest phase of the
	trade before retreating in the face of competition, began to
	expand again in the late nineteenth century with the growth of the
	Cuban sugar economy.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}Yet, in the next century - between 1750 and 1850 – every one
	of these empires had either disappeared or become severely
	truncated. A massive shift to freer trade meant that instead of six
	plantation empires controlled from Europe, there were now only three
	plantation complexes, two of which—Brazil and the United
	States—were independent, and the third, Cuba, was far wealthier and
	more dynamic than its European owner. Extreme specialization now
	saw the United States producing most of the world’s cotton, Cuba
	most of the world’s sugar, and Brazil with a similar dominance in
	coffee. Slaves thus might disembark in six separate jurisdictions
	in the Americas in the eighteenth century, but by 1850 they went
	overwhelmingly to only two areas, Brazil and Cuba, given that
	American cotton planters drew on Africa for almost none of their
	labor needs, relying instead on natural population growth and a
	domestic slave trade. Indeed, overall the United States absorbed
	only 5 percent of the slaves arriving in the Americas. This massive
	reorganization of the traffic and the rapid natural growth of the
	US slave population had little immediate impact on the size of the
	slave trade. The British, Americans, Danish, and Dutch dropped out of the
	slave trade, but the decade 1821 to 1830 still saw over 80,000
	people a year leaving Africa in slave ships. Well over a million
	more – one tenth of the volume carried off in the slave trade era -
	followed in the next twenty years.{% endblocktrans %}
