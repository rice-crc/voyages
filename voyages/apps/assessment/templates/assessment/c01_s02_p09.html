	{% blocktrans %}In many markets in the Atlantic world monthly cycles of
	slave exports and imports, documented in the <a
	href="{{ voyage_search_url }}">Voyages Database</a>, link to dry
	season crop harvests. African and European dealers on the African
	coast purchased provisions and slaves. Some markets, such as those
	along the Senegal and Gambia Rivers, had distinct
	provisioning-slaving seasons. Ecological conditions set
	agricultural calendars and the dates when workers gathered and
	stored foodstuffs. African middlemen pegged their slave-trading
	seasons to in-crop months, and some agricultural workers, sold into
	the overseas slave trade, may have been forced to consume the foods
	they produced. By moving captives between harvests on the Atlantic
	littoral, slaving ship captains created regular pathways, such as
	those between yam-growing Bight of Biafra and the sugar islands of
	the Caribbean, or those between millet-rice Upper Guinea region and
	North American rice and tobacco lands. In examining slave trading
	routes, historians need to consider agricultural calendars on both
	sides of the Atlantic.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}Though there were monthly cycles of slave exports and
	imports, year-round shipments took place in all markets during the
	350-year history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In the most
	seasonal African slaving region—Senegambia—about fifteen percent of
	all enslaved Africans departed the coast in the out-of-crop, rainy,
	September-November quarter. Even in the most seasonal market in the
	Atlantic slaving world—the northern plantations of Virginia and
	Maryland (36-39° N)—small numbers of forced migrants arrived in the
	winter, when no crops were grown. In the large Bight of Biafra –
	Jamaica migration stream, forty percent of enslaved Africans
	arrived on the island during the June-November out-of-crop season.
	And many would have sailed from Bonny, Old Calabar or New Calabar
	from April to July when yam stocks were low or depleted.
	Variability in the Middle Passage voyage time, due to contrary
	winds, caused some captains to arrive out of season; one assumes
	that there also was variability in the time taken to march captives
	towards the African coast.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}It is important to examine these unseasonal slave trades. In
	Africa, they remind us that the slave trade was a predatory
	activity. Warfare between African states often took place after the
	principal grain harvest and during the dry season, but conflicts
	could erupt at any time, and during every day of the year raiders
	could attack communities or kidnap people. Seasonal rainfall and
	crop-growing constraints did not completely limit the plunder of
	people. Captains who traded towards the end of “in-crop” seasons in
	Africa, such as Robert Doegood, risked purchasing greater numbers
	of malnourished men, women and children. Doegood traded at New
	Calabar when yam supplies were low; his logbook reveals that eighty
	Africans died on the Middle Passage (of 348 people) and four more
	in harbor at Barbados. Historians should examine more closely the
	links between provisioning-slaving seasons and mortality. In the
	Americas, investors were willing to purchase enslaved labor from
	any African region during any day of the year—the labor of enslaved
	Africans maintained the Colonial System. Trading during out of crop
	seasons, on both sides of the Atlantic, increased the chances that
	irregular, non-systematic migration patterns occurred—a true
	diaspora or “scattering” of African peoples in the Americas.{% endblocktrans %}
