	{% blocktrans %}With the key forces shaping the traffic briefly described,
	we can now turn to a short narrative of the slave trade. The first
	Africans forced to work in the New World left from Europe at the
	beginning of the sixteenth century, not from Africa. There were few
	vessels that carried only slaves on this early route, so that most
	would have crossed the Atlantic in smaller groups on vessels
	carrying many other commodities, rather than dedicated slave ships.
	Such a slave route was possible because an extensive traffic in
	African slaves from Africa to Europe and the Atlantic islands had
	existed for half a century before Columbian contact, such that ten
	percent of the population of Lisbon was black in 1455,(2) and black
	slaves were common on large estates in the Portuguese Algarve. The
	<a href="{{ voyage_voyage }}?voyageId=46474">first slave voyage</a>
	direct from Africa to the Americas probably
	sailed in 1526. Before mid-century, all trans-Atlantic slave ships
	sold their slaves in the Spanish Caribbean, with the gold mines in
	Cibao on Hispaniola emerging as a major purchaser. <a href="{{ voyage_voyage }}?voyageId=29647">Cartagena</a>, in
	modern Columbia, appears as the first mainland Spanish American
	destination for a slave vessel - in the year 1549. On the African
	side, the great majority of people entering the early slave trade
	came from the Upper Guinea coast, and moved through Portuguese
	factories initially in Arguim, and later the Cape Verde islands.
	Nevertheless, the 1526 voyage set out from the other major
	Portuguese factory in West Africa - Sao Tome in the Bight of Biafra
	â€“ though the slaves almost certainly originated in the Congo.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}The slave traffic to Brazil, eventually accounting for about
	forty percent of the trade, got underway around 1560. Sugar drove
	this traffic, as Africans gradually replaced the Amerindian labor
	force on which the early sugar mills (called engenhos) had drawn
	over the period 1560 to 1620. By the time the Dutch invaded Brazil
	in 1630, Pernambuco, Bahia, and Rio de Janeiro were supplying almost
	all of the sugar consumed in Europe, and almost all the slaves
	producing it were African. Consistent with the earlier discussion
	of Atlantic wind and ocean currents, there were by 1640 two major
	branches of the trans-Atlantic slave trade operating, one to Brazil,
	and the other to the mainland Spanish Americas, but together they
	accounted for less 7,500 departures a year from the whole of
	sub-Saharan Africa, almost all of them by 1600 from west-central
	Africa. The sugar complex spread to the eastern Caribbean from the
	beginning of the 1640s. Sugar consumption steadily increased in
	Europe, and the slave system began <a href="{{ assessment_intro-maps }}#map4">two centuries of westward
	expansion</a> across tropical and sub-tropical North America. At the
	end of the seventeenth century, gold discoveries in first Minas
	Gerais, and later in Goias and other parts of Brazil, began a
	transformation of the slave trade which triggered further expansion
	of the business. In Africa, the Bights of Benin and Biafra became
	major sources of supply, in addition to Angola, and were joined
	later by the more marginal provenance zones of Sierra Leone, the
	Windward Coast, and South-east Africa. The volume of slaves carried
	off reached thirty thousand per annum in the 1690s and eighty-five
	thousand a century later. More than eight out of ten Africans
	pulled into the traffic in the era of the slave trade made their
	journeys in the century and a half after 1700.{% endblocktrans %}
