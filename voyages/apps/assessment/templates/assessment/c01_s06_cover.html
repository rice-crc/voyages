	{% blocktrans %}The Voyages Database has the potential to be of value to those
	interested in current affairs, as well as to scholars involved in
	strictly academic research. One area where the database can be
	useful is the debate over the payment of reparations, monetary
	or otherwise, to descendants from the survivors of the Middle
	Passage. Other possible fields are those of business and family
	history. In this context, the database has helped to establish
	connections between the predecessors of a major international
	financial institution, the Dutch bank ABN AMRO, and African
	slavery in the Americas. It proved especially helpful in tracing
	the bank’s historical involvement in various financial aspects of
	the slave trade. Employing some of the database’s basic variables,
	we can see how the database can be used effectively in applied
	history, a joint endeavor in which historians collaborate to
	answer questions raised by other professionals.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}In 2005-2006, at the direction of LaSalle Bank Corporation,
	at the time the U.S. subsidiary of ABN AMRO, History Associates
	Incorporated conducted a study of the Dutch bank’s predecessors to
	determine historical connections to African slavery in the United
	States and elsewhere in the Americas. In combination with archival
	research, the Voyages Database substantiated
	evidence that some of the bank’s predecessors provided insurance
	for slaving voyages, purchased interest in slaving voyages, or
	supplied credit to clients participating in the slave trade.{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}Logbooks at the Rotterdam municipal archives indicate
	that the Rotterdam banking firm of Chabot brokered insurance on
	cargo carried by the ship <span class="italic">Vrouw Maria Isabella</span>, commanded by
	Carsten Edebool, in 1774. The database confirmed that this vessel
	set out on a slaving voyage to Africa and Surinam (<a
	href="{{ voyage_voyage_url }}?voyageId=10830">Voyage ID 10830</a>).
	Moreover, comparing entries from the account books of the Mallet
	brothers with vessel names in the database, it was found that
	this French firm held interests in several vessels connected
	with the trans-Atlantic slave trade during the late 1700s.
	Examples of slaving vessels in which the Mallets had invested
	included the <span class="italic">Infant d’Angole</span> (owned by Renault and Dubois ),
	the <span class="italic">Dame Cécile</span> (owned by J. R. Wirtz and Company) as well as
	the <span class="italic">Madame, Henri Quatre</span>
	and <span class="italic">Magdeleine</span> (all owned by
	Delaville and Barthelemy). Similarly, the house of Mallet
	as well as another French predecessor, Banque André, had
	business dealings with numerous persons and firms which
	the database identified as outfitters of slaving voyages.
	For example, the Nantes houses of Ambroise Perrotin,
	Auguste Simon, and Fruchard Fils all received substantial
	loans from Mallet at the time they organized slaving
	voyages to Africa. Meantime, in 1819 the bank of
	André negotiated a loan of FF 15,000 with Vasse-Mancel
	from Le Havre, who five years later organized a
	slaving voyage to Senegal
	(<a	href="{{ voyage_voyage_url }}?voyageId=34411">Voyage ID 34411</a>),
	while in 1823 they arranged payments on behalf of Philippon and Company
	from Le Havre for purchases in Liverpool for a slaving voyage to
	Brazil (<a href="{{ voyage_voyage_url }}?voyageId=34376">Voyage
	ID 34376</a>).{% endblocktrans %}

	{% blocktrans %}The study by History Associates made use of only three basic variables
	in the Voyages Database: vessel, captain, and owner names. Nevertheless,
	the database confirmed that important connections existed between the
	European world of high finance and the trans-Atlantic slave trade in
	the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.{% endblocktrans %}
