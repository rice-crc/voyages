<h2>{% trans "Special Thanks" %}</h2>

<p>
	{% blocktrans %}Many people contributed to the successful completion of this
	project – enough that we fear in our attempts to acknowledge them,
	we may only call attention to having forgotten someone and their
	worthy assistance in our efforts. With apologies for any
	regrettable omissions and our sincerest thanks to everyone, named
	or anonymous, who graciously gave their time and expertise, we
	would like to especially acknowledge the following individuals.{% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
	{% blocktrans %}Many individuals at Emory University’s Robert W. Woodruff Library
	took time outside of their already busy schedules and routine work in
	order to answer our questions, assist with various project tasks, and
	generally support the life of the project. Rob Riley’s early advice on
	and examples of database systems sparked ideas for our own database.
	Naomi Nelson and Teresa Burk of MARBL (<a href="http://marbl.library.emory.edu">Manuscript, Archives, and Rare
	Book Library</a>) helped locate and prepare rare materials for digitizing
	as well as for various presentations on the project. Anne Frellsen, of
	the <a href="http://web.library.emory.edu/preservation">Preservation Office at Emory University Libraries</a>, assisted also with
	digitizing efforts and met with members of our team to discuss best practices
	for photographing and digitizing historical artifacts. Lisa Macklin’s advice
	on copyright helped guide the collection of images for the site. At the
	insistence of Lea McLees, the library’s Director of Communications, we
	documented our work on the project – a task greatly aided by Francine Thurston,
	Matt Miller, and Sarah Toton, who all gave generously of their time and abilities
	in photography, videography, and video editing, respectively. Jim Kruse,
	Shannon O’Daniel, and other members of both <a href="http://cet.emory.edu/ecit/">Emory’s Center for Interactive
	Teaching (ECIT)</a> and <a href="http://it.emory.edu/showdoc.cfm?docid=8129">University Technology Services (UTS)</a> regularly and
	graciously gave their time, tools and resources, and expertise to help
	ensure that all team members – both on site and off – could fully participate
	in project meetings. Finally, Ginger Cain’s enthusiasm and energy for sharing
	information about the project continues to put us in touch with new people
	interested in the project and new possibilities for continuing this work.{% endblocktrans %}
