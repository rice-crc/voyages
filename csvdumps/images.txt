Biafra, on April 15th, 1822. She departed from Nantes, in France, and carried 345 slaves 
from the coast of Africa, but she was intercepted by anti-slave trade cruisers before 
sailing to the Americas and taken to Freetown, Sierra Leone. The English had no rights to 
detain vessels under the French flag, and the cruiser had approached the “Vigilante” only 
in order to verify its papers. The French captain, fearing detention, opened fire killing 
several of the cruiser’s crew. It was only then that the “Vigilante” was taken captive and 
escorted to first Sierra Leone where the slaves were disembarked, and then to Plymouth, 
England, where the English captain hoped to lay murder charges. Abolitionists drew the 
vessel while it was in Plymouth. In the event, the vessel and crew were released without 
charges. The image is of a plan of the “Vigilante”, showing the slave decks and the 
instruments used to chain the slaves. This plan was published as a fold out in a pamphlet 
printed first in London and then Paris and other places in 1823. The image is reproduced

only later, in the nineteenth century. In 1815, with the suppression of the slave trade in 
the North Atlantic, traders began to search for new slave markets on the coast of 
Mozambique, in South-East Africa. Sofala was among the ports located on that coast with 
slave trading potential. The image is of a map of Sofala. It shows the depth of the sea

Calabar and Bonny were two important slaving outlets in the Bight of Biafra, in today's 
eastern Nigeria. The “Carte de la Riviere de Kalbar” contains information collected from 
ship pilots in 1699, and was published in English in 1732 in volume five of Churchill’s 
collection of voyages and travels. That map and the one reproduced here, printed in French 
in the late 1740s, illustrates the Real River and adjoining creeks, and locates the 
village of New Calabar (“Ville du Nouveau Kalabar”) and Bonny (“Ville de Bandi”). It also 
places the village of Old Calabar (“Vieux Kalabar”) between New Calabar and Bonny, 
indicating that in the later 1600s there were two “Calabar” villages in the Rio Real. Old 
Calabar—“Calabar” in the Voyages Database and Calabar, Nigeria today—is located fifty 
miles east and a further forty-five miles up the Cross River. This map also shows Foko 
Island (Fockey in the Voyages Database) and the Doni River and village (Andony). In the 
1600s New Calabar was the most important slaving and ivory location in the Bight of 
Biafra; by the 1730s Bonny emerged as the leading regional slaving port. The Bight’s ivory 
trade had then shifted east to Old Calabar and Cameroon."	"1024"	"604"	"image/jpeg"	"Jacques Nicolas Bellin"	"fr"	"346987"	"Steve Behrendt, private collection"	"\N"	"\N"	"f"	"\N"	"3"	"4"	"t"	"0"	"3"	"1699"	"new-calabar-and-bonny"
