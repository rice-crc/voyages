What to check after deployment
==============================

* Main search results: should have over 34,000 voyages.
* Is the Solr index updated / rebuilt? Try a few searches: by itinerary, by vessel name etc.
* African Names - should have over 90,000 records. Also try the search functionality.
* Images: see if the thumbnails are properly displayed on the Resources|Images page.
* Run unit tests.
